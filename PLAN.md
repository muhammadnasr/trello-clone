## Architecture Overview

The application uses RxDB as the core local-first database layer:

- **UI Layer**: React components with Shadcn-UI and TailwindCSS v4
- **State Layer**: Zustand stores (synced with RxDB reactive queries)
- **Database Layer**: RxDB with IndexedDB storage
- **Sync Layer**: 
  - Same-device tabs: RxDB BroadcastChannel replication
  - Cross-device: RxDB Firestore replication plugin
- **Routing**: TanStack Router

---

## 📋 Evaluation Criteria

Please keep in mind that **a shift in mindset is also part of what we are evaluating**.

Using RxDB is acceptable, as long as the solution clearly demonstrates:
- ✅ **Working with new concepts and approaches**: The implementation should show understanding and effective use of RxDB's reactive programming model, local-first architecture, and multi-tab synchronization
- ✅ **Well-structured data flow**: Clear separation between database layer (RxDB), state management (Zustand), and UI components
- ✅ **Maintainable architecture**: Code organization, type safety, and patterns that make the codebase easy to understand and extend

**Key Evaluation Points:**
- How well the reactive data flow is implemented (RxDB → Zustand → UI)
- Understanding of local-first principles and offline-first capabilities
- Proper use of RxDB features (reactive queries, multi-instance sync, schema validation)
- Code quality, structure, and maintainability
- Test coverage and quality

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **RxDB** - Local-first database with built-in IndexedDB storage, BroadcastChannel sync, and Firestore replication. ✅ **Verified**: Excellent choice - offline functionality works seamlessly with LWW conflict resolution.
2. **Firebase Firestore** (not Realtime Database) - RxDB has built-in Firestore replication plugin with LWW conflict resolution
3. **Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** - RxDB handles conflict resolution automatically using timestamps. ✅ **Tested**: Works correctly in offline scenarios.
4. **Optimistic Updates** - UI updates immediately via RxDB reactive queries, sync happens in background
5. **RxDB Collections** - Each entity type (boards, columns, cards) will be an RxDB collection with reactive queries
6. **Zustand + RxDB** - Zustand for UI state management, RxDB for persistence and sync (connected via reactive queries)

## Documentation Requirements

- **Architecture Documentation**: Detailed README explaining:
  - Why RxDB was chosen (local-first, built-in sync, conflict resolution)
  - How RxDB handles IndexedDB persistence
  - How BroadcastChannel replication works for multi-tab sync
  - How Firestore replication works for cross-device sync
  - LWW conflict resolution strategy and how RxDB implements it
  - Offline queue mechanism in RxDB
  - Trade-offs and design decisions

- **Code Comments**: Add comments in key files explaining:
  - RxDB schema design decisions
  - How reactive queries keep Zustand in sync
  - Replication configuration and what it does
  - Conflict resolution behavior

## Success Criteria for Each Step

- All tests pass (green)
- Code compiles without errors
- Manual verification works (where applicable)
- No regressions in previous steps
- Documentation updated (where applicable)

## Refactoring & Code Quality Improvements

### ✅ Parallel Sync Subscriptions with `ownerId` Filtering (COMPLETED)

**Goal**: Refactor sync function to use parallel subscriptions instead of chained dependencies, making it more scalable and efficient.

**What Was Done**:
- Added `ownerId` field to Column schema and TypeScript type
- Updated `createColumn` service to accept `ownerId` parameter
- Updated `CreateColumnDialog` to get `ownerId` from auth store
- Refactored `syncStoresToDatabase` to use parallel subscriptions:
  - Boards subscription: filters by `ownerId` directly
  - Columns subscription: filters by `ownerId` directly (independent, no chaining)
  - Both subscriptions run in parallel with no dependencies
- Updated all tests to pass `ownerId` when creating columns

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Simpler sync logic: no dependency chain between boards and columns
- ✅ Scalable: adding cards will follow the same pattern (filter by `ownerId`)
- ✅ Better performance: parallel subscriptions instead of sequential
- ✅ No race conditions: each subscription is independent
- ✅ Easier to maintain: clear separation of concerns

**Impact**: This refactoring makes the codebase ready for adding cards with minimal changes. Cards will follow the same pattern: add `ownerId` to schema and filter by `ownerId` in a parallel subscription.

### Consolidate Create/Rename Dialogs

**Goal**: Reduce code duplication by creating a single reusable dialog component for creating and renaming entities (boards, columns, cards).

**Current State**:
- Separate dialogs for create/rename operations:
  - `CreateBoardDialog` - creates boards
  - `RenameColumnDialog` - renames columns
  - `CreateColumnDialog` - creates columns
  - Inline rename dialog in `BoardCard` component

**Proposed Solution**:
- Create a generic `EntityDialog` component that can handle both create and rename modes
- Accept props: `mode` ('create' | 'rename'), `entityType` ('board' | 'column' | 'card'), `initialValue` (for rename), `onSubmit`, `onCancel`
- Replace all existing create/rename dialogs with this unified component
- Benefits:
  - Single source of truth for dialog UI/UX
  - Easier to maintain and update
  - Consistent behavior across all entities
  - Less code duplication

**Implementation Notes**:
- Keep existing functionality intact
- Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring
- Update component imports across the codebase

### Replace Dynamic Imports with Static Imports in Tests

**Goal**: Simplify test code by using static imports instead of dynamic `await import()` calls.

**Current State**:
- Test files use `await import('../../../src/lib/services/boards')` inside test functions
- Dynamic imports are used in:
  - `tests/components/boards/BoardsList.integration.test.tsx`
  - `tests/components/columns/ColumnsList.integration.test.tsx`
  - `tests/lib/db/replication.test.ts`

**Why Dynamic Imports Were Used**:
- Originally used to ensure mocks are set up before importing modules
- To avoid circular dependencies in some cases

**Proposed Solution**:
- Replace `await import()` with static `import` statements at the top of test files
- Vitest hoists `vi.mock()` calls, so static imports work correctly
- Benefits:
  - Cleaner, more readable code
  - Standard JavaScript/TypeScript import pattern
  - Better IDE support and autocomplete
  - Easier to understand and maintain

**Implementation Notes**:
- Verify all tests still pass after conversion
- Some dynamic imports may be necessary (e.g., Firebase mocks that need to be set up first)
- Keep dynamic imports only where truly needed (document why)

### Component Re-render Optimization

**Goal**: Optimize component re-renders to prevent unnecessary updates when unrelated store values change.

**Current State**:
- Components re-render whenever any store value changes, even unrelated ones
- No React.memo or derived state optimization
- Multiple `useBoardsStore` / `useColumnsStore` calls in same component (e.g., `BoardsList.tsx`, `CreateBoardDialog.tsx`)
- Components subscribe to entire store slices rather than specific selectors

**Proposed Solution**:
- Consolidate multiple store selector calls into single selector that returns object of needed values
- Add `React.memo` to leaf components that receive primitive props (e.g., `BoardCard`, `ColumnCard`)
- Consider selector memoization for complex derived state
- Use Zustand's `shallow` equality check when selecting multiple values

**Benefits**:
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Better performance, especially as app scales
- More efficient React rendering cycles
- Better user experience with smoother UI updates

**Implementation Notes**:
- Keep current architecture - stores are well-structured
- This is a performance optimization, not a critical issue for current scale
- Verify all tests still pass after optimization
- Measure performance impact before/after if possible

### Remove Unnecessary setTimeout in Integration Tests

**Goal**: Remove artificial delays (`setTimeout`) from integration tests that were added as workarounds for sync timing issues.

**Current State**:
- `CardsList.integration.test.tsx` has multiple `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100))` calls
- These were added to wait for auth state sync, but should be handled with proper `waitFor` assertions instead

**Proposed Solution**:
- Remove all `setTimeout` calls used for waiting on sync
- Replace with proper `waitFor` assertions that check for expected state changes
- Use `waitFor` to verify store state is updated rather than arbitrary delays
- Benefits:
  - More reliable tests (wait for actual conditions, not arbitrary time)
  - Faster test execution
  - Better test maintainability

**Implementation Notes**:
- Verify all tests still pass after removing setTimeout
- Ensure proper waitFor assertions are in place for auth state changes

### Revise useEffects

**Goal**: Review and optimize `useEffect` hooks across components to ensure they follow best practices and avoid unnecessary re-renders or side effects.

**Current State**:
- Multiple components use `useEffect` for various purposes (sync state, focus management, etc.)
- Some effects may have unnecessary dependencies or missing cleanup
- Need to review for:
  - Proper dependency arrays
  - Cleanup functions where needed
  - Avoiding cascading re-renders
  - Ensuring effects only run when necessary

**Proposed Solution**:
- Audit all `useEffect` hooks in card-related components (`Card.tsx`, `CreateCard.tsx`, etc.)
- Review effects for:
  - Correct dependency arrays
  - Proper cleanup (remove event listeners, cancel subscriptions, etc.)
  - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders (e.g., syncing state only when props actually change)
  - Using refs where appropriate to avoid dependency issues
- Benefits:
  - More predictable component behavior
  - Better performance
  - Fewer bugs from stale closures or missing cleanup

**Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on card components first (Card.tsx, CreateCard.tsx)
- Verify all tests still pass after revisions
- Ensure no regressions in component behavior
